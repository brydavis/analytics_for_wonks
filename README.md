# Data Basics for Policy Wonks

![alt text](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png "Python gives you wings!")


The purpose of this repository is to provide reusable examples for basic data processing (cleaning and manipulation) and analysis with the *policy analyst* in mind.  Examples will be grouped by task; within each task group will by examples using Python (`.py`) and R (`.R`).  Subsequent tasks build on examples in previous tasks (e.g. *scripts for analyzing data build on scripts for uploading and processing said data*). If you haven't yet, please download and install the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python; once installed, don't forget to install [R](https://www.continuum.io/conda-for-r) by running `conda install -c r r` in command prompt or the terminal.
