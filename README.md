# Data Basics for Policy Wonks
The purpose of this repository is to provide reusable examples for basic data processing (cleaning and manipulation) and analysis with the *policy analyst* in mind.  Examples will be grouped by task; within each task group will by examples using Python (`.py`) and R (`.R`).  Subsequent tasks build on examples in previous tasks (e.g. *scripts for analyzing data build on scripts for uploading and processing said data*). 

###	Uploading
- *How do I upload / import data?*

###	Processing
- *How do I clean / manipulate data before performing my analysis?*

###	Analyzing
- *I'm done processing data, how do I analyse it?*

###	Visualizing
- *How do I quickly visualize my data?*

###	Exporting
- *Is there a way to export my data or a report to a `.xlsx` or `.csv` file?*
